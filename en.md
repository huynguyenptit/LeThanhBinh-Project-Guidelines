## 5. Testing
![Testing](https://github.com/wearehive/project-guidelines/raw/master/images/testing.png)
* Have a `test` mode environment if needed.

    _Why:_
    > While sometimes end to end testing in `production` mode might seem enough, there are some exceptions: One example is you may not want to enable analytical information on a 'production' mode and pollute someone's dashboard with test data. The other example is that your API may have rate limits in `production` and blocks your test calls after a certain amount of requests. 

* Place your test files next to the tested modules using `*.test.js` or `*.spec.js` naming convention, like `moduleName.spec.js`.

    _Why:_
    > You don't want to dig through a folder structure to find a unit test. [read more...](https://hackernoon.com/structure-your-javascript-code-for-testability-9bc93d9c72dc)
    

* Put your additional test files into a separate test folder to avoid confusion.

    _Why:_
    > Some test files don't particularly relate to any specific implementation file. You have to put it in a folder that is most likely to be found by other developers: `__test__` folder. This name: `__test__`  is also standard now and gets picked up by most JavaScript testing frameworks.

* Write testable code, avoid side effects, extract side effects, write pure functions

    _Why:_
    > You want to test a business logic as separate units. You have to "minimize the impact of randomness and nondeterministic processes on the reliability of your code". [read more...](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/tdd-the-rite-way-53c9b46f45e3)
    
    > A pure function is a function that always returns the same output for the same input. Conversely, an impure function is one that may have side effects or depends on conditions from the outside to produce a value. That makes it less predictable. [read more...](https://hackernoon.com/structure-your-javascript-code-for-testability-9bc93d9c72dc)

* Use a static type checker 

    _Why:_
    > Sometimes you may need a Static type checker. It brings a certain level of reliability to your code. [read more...](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/why-use-static-types-in-javascript-part-1-8382da1e0adb)


* Run tests locally before making any pull requests to `develop`.

    _Why:_
    > You don't want to be the one who caused production-ready branch build to fail. Run your tests after your `rebase` and before pushing your feature-branch to a remote repository.

* Document your tests including instructions in the relevant section of your `README.md` file.

    _Why:_
    > It's a handy note you leave behind for other developers or DevOps experts or QA or anyone who gets lucky enough to work on your code.

## 6. Structure and Naming
![Structure and Naming](https://github.com/wearehive/project-guidelines/raw/master/images/folder-tree.png)
* Organize your files around product features / pages / components, not roles. Also, place your test files next to their implementation.


    **Bad**

    ```
    .
    ├── controllers
    |   ├── product.js
    |   └── user.js
    ├── models
    |   ├── product.js
    |   └── user.js
    ```

    **Good**

    ```
    .
    ├── product
    |   ├── index.js
    |   ├── product.js
    |   └── product.test.js
    ├── user
    |   ├── index.js
    |   ├── user.js
    |   └── user.test.js
    ```

    _Why:_
    > Instead of a long list of files, you will create small modules that encapsulate one responsibility including its test and so on. It gets much easier to navigate through and things can be found at a glance.

* Put your additional test files to a separate test folder to avoid confusion.

    _Why:_
    > It is a time saver for other developers or DevOps experts in your team.

* Use a `./config` folder and don't make different config files for different environments.

    _Why:_
    >When you break down a config file for different purposes (database, API and so on); putting them in a folder with a very recognizable name such as `config` makes sense. Just remember not to make different config files for different environments. It doesn't scale cleanly, as more deploys of the app are created, new environment names are necessary.
    Values to be used in config files should be provided by environment variables. [read more...](https://medium.com/@fedorHK/no-config-b3f1171eecd5)
    

* Put your scripts in a `./scripts` folder. This includes `bash` and `node` scripts.

    _Why:_
    >It's very likely you may end up with more than one script, production build, development build, database feeders, database synchronization and so on.
    

* Place your build output in a `./build` folder. Add `build/` to `.gitignore`.

    _Why:_
    >Name it what you like, `dist` is also cool. But make sure that keep it consistent with your team. What gets in there is most likely generated  (bundled, compiled, transpiled) or moved there. What you can generate, your teammates should be able to generate too, so there is no point committing them into your remote repository. Unless you specifically want to.

## 7. Code style

![Code style](https://github.com/wearehive/project-guidelines/raw/master/images/code-style.png)

<a name="code-style-check"></a>
### 7.1 Some code style guidelines

* Use stage-2 and higher JavaScript (modern) syntax for new projects. For old project stay consistent with existing syntax unless you intend to modernise the project.

    _Why:_
    > This is all up to you. We use transpilers to use advantages of new syntax. stage-2 is more likely to eventually become part of the spec with only minor revisions. 

* Include code style check in your build process.

    _Why:_
    > Breaking your build is one way of enforcing code style to your code. It prevents you from taking it less seriously. Do it for both client and server-side code. [read more...](https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-eslint-webpack-babel/)

* Use [ESLint - Pluggable JavaScript linter](http://eslint.org/) to enforce code style.

    _Why:_
    > We simply prefer `eslint`, you don't have to. It has more rules supported, the ability to configure the rules, and ability to add custom rules.

* We use [Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) for JavaScript, [Read more](https://www.gitbook.com/book/duk/airbnb-javascript-guidelines/details). Use the javascript style guide required by the project or your team.

* We use [Flow type style check rules for ESLint](https://github.com/gajus/eslint-plugin-flowtype) when using [FlowType](https://flow.org/).

    _Why:_
    > Flow introduces few syntaxes that also need to follow certain code style and be checked.

* Use `.eslintignore` to exclude files or folders from code style checks.

    _Why:_
    > You don't have to pollute your code with `eslint-disable` comments whenever you need to exclude a couple of files from style checking.

* Remove any of your `eslint` disable comments before making a Pull Request.

    _Why:_
    > It's normal to disable style check while working on a code block to focus more on the logic. Just remember to remove those `eslint-disable` comments and follow the rules.

* Depending on the size of the task use  `//TODO:` comments or open a ticket.

    _Why:_
    > So then you can remind yourself and others about a small task (like refactoring a function or updating a comment). For larger tasks use `//TODO(#3456)` which is enforced by a lint rule and the number is an open ticket.


* Always comment and keep them relevant as code changes. Remove commented blocks of code.
    
    _Why:_
    > Your code should be as readable as possible, you should get rid of anything distracting. If you refactored a function, don't just comment out the old one, remove it.

* Avoid irrelevant or funny comments, logs or naming.

    _Why:_
    > While your build process may(should) get rid of them, sometimes your source code may get handed over to another company/client and they may not share the same banter.

* Make your names search-able with meaningful distinctions avoid shortened names. For functions use long, descriptive names. A function name should be a verb or a verb phrase, and it needs to communicate its intention.

    _Why:_
    > It makes it more natural to read the source code.

* Organize your functions in a file according to the step-down rule. Higher level functions should be on top and lower levels below.

    _Why:_
    > It makes it more natural to read the source code.

<a name="enforcing-code-style-standards"></a>
### 7.2 Enforcing code style standards

* Use a [.editorconfig](https://github.com/wearehive/project-guidelines/raw/master/images/logging.png) file which helps developers define and maintain consistent coding styles between different editors and IDEs on the project.

    _Why:_
    > The EditorConfig project consists of a file format for defining coding styles and a collection of text editor plugins that enable editors to read the file format and adhere to defined styles. EditorConfig files are easily readable and they work nicely with version control systems.

* Have your editor notify you about code style errors. Use [eslint-plugin-prettier](https://github.com/prettier/eslint-plugin-prettier) and [eslint-config-prettier](https://github.com/prettier/eslint-config-prettier) with your existing ESLint configuration. [read more...](https://github.com/prettier/eslint-config-prettier#installation)

* Consider using Git hooks.

    _Why:_
    > Git hooks greatly increase a developer's productivity. Make changes, commit and push to staging or production environments without the fear of breaking builds. [read more...](http://githooks.com/)

* Use Prettier with a precommit hook.

    _Why:_
    > While `prettier` itself can be very powerful, it's not very productive to run it simply as an npm task alone each time to format code. This is where `lint-staged` (and `husky`) come into play. Read more on configuring `lint-staged` [here](https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged#configuration) and on configuring `husky` [here](https://github.com/typicode/husky).

## 8. Logging

![Logging](/images/logging.png)

* Avoid client-side console logs in production

    _Why:_
    > Even though your build process can (should) get rid of them, make sure that your code style checker warns you about leftover console logs.

* Produce readable production logging. Ideally use logging libraries to be used in production mode (such as [winston](https://github.com/winstonjs/winston) or
[node-bunyan](https://github.com/trentm/node-bunyan)).

    _Why:_
    > It makes your troubleshooting less unpleasant with colorization, timestamps, log to a file in addition to the console or even logging to a file that rotates daily. [read more...](https://blog.risingstack.com/node-js-logging-tutorial/)
